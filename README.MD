# patChat
## a multi-threaded LAN instant messenger 
   This was my first experience working with
multi-threaded programming and java network programming in general.
I'll be tinkering with this project from time to time to experiment
with new features and to work out some of the eccentricities of
the project as it is.

and chatting with each other independently on localhost.
